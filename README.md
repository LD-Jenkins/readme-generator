# <p>README Generator<span style='float: right;'></span></p>


## Project Description

    This README was created using this project! With the use of Node.js, an installed module 'inquirer' and a core module 'fs' you too can generate README's for your projects.

## Installation

    All that's needed to use this README generator is to grab the index.js and package.json files. Make sure to include a .gitignore if you will be uploading this to a GitHub repo and ignore, at the very least, the node_modules/ folder that is generated after you've run 'node install' to install the necessary dependencies in the package.json file.

    Once you see index.js, .gitignore, package.json, and package-lock.json in the directory you intend to use for your project, you're all set!

## Usage

    If you ever need a simple README for your project, this is the tool for you! A template is provided using markdown rules. All you must do is answer the prompts to essentially fill in the blanks for your project (plus a little personal information if you wish, such as an email to reach you at and your github account name).

    Any prompt you answer will insert anything you type into the template. This means you can add your own markdown if you wish!
    

## Testing

    Once installed, use node to run the index.js file and follow the prompts. The prompts will ask you for things like a project title, installation instructions, testing instructions, etc. If you would like to not fill out any part while going through the prompts simply hit enter to skip it and a default value will be entered (a simple description of what would go in that part of the README).

    The last prompt will ask you to enter a filename to save everything to. WARNING: If the filename already exists in the same directory you are working from the exisiting data in that file will be overwritten! You do not have to include the file extension as the file will be saved as .md regardless.
